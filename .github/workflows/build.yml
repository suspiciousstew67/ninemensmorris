name: Build and Release macOS App

# --- CHANGE 1: TRIGGER ---
# Instead of running on every push to 'main', this workflow now runs ONLY
# when you push a new tag that starts with 'v' (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.2.1).
# This is the standard practice for triggering release builds.
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build-and-release: # Renamed job for clarity
    runs-on: macos-latest

    # --- CHANGE 2: PERMISSIONS ---
    # We need to grant the workflow permission to create a GitHub Release
    # and upload the built .dmg file as an asset to that release.

      # --- CHANGE 3: REPLACE UPLOAD ARTIFACT WITH CREATE RELEASE ---
      # This new step replaces the old 'Upload Artifact'. Instead of creating a temporary
      # artifact, it will create a permanent, public GitHub Release and upload
      # your .dmg file there for everyone to download.
